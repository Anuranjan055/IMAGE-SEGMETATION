# IMAGE-SEGMETATION
There are various method of image segmentation such as Thesholding method, Edge Based Method, Reegion Based method, Clustering Method and many more.
In this project I have done segmentation of image using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

# Gaussian mixture models (GMM)

- GMM are based on the assumption that all data points come from a fine mixture of Gaussian distributions with unkonw parameters.
- Once we learn the Gaussian parameters, we can generate data from the same distribution as the sourse.
