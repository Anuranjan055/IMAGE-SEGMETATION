# IMAGE-SEGMETATION
There are various method of image segmentation such as Thesholding method, Edge Based Method, Reegion Based method, Clustering Method and many more.
In this project I have done segmentation of image using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

# Gaussian mixture models (GMM)

- GMM are based on the assumption that all data points come from a fine mixture of Gaussian distributions with unkonw parameters.
- Once we learn the Gaussian parameters, we can generate data from the same distribution as the sourse.
 Suppose there are set of data points that needs to be grouped into several parts or clusters based on their similarty. In machine learning this known as ** clustring **
